-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md # Views in the Lakehouse
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Register views to create stable, secure queries in the Lakehouse.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC In this lesson, we'll give a quick overview of how stored views are created and managed.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Rather than trying to capture every possible metric in our view, we'll create a summary of values that might be of interest to our analysts.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC 0. Views as saved queries
-- MAGIC 0. Aliasing tables to views
-- MAGIC 0. Dynamic views

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC ## Run Setup
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC The setup script will create the data and declare necessary values for the rest of this notebook to execute.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %run ../Includes/setup-transform

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md ## Views as saved queries
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC A Spark DataFrame and a view are nearly identical constructs. By calling `EXPLAIN` on our DataFrame, we can see that our source table is a set of instructions to deserialize the files containing our data.

-- COMMAND ----------

EXPLAIN FORMATTED SELECT * FROM transactions

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md ## Aliasing Tables to Views

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC ### Examine Clickpath Data
-- MAGIC Define logic that creates or updates a table that aggregates the number of times each user took a particular action and then join this information with the flattened view of transactions created earlier. This will combine data from the `events_clean` and `transactions` tables in order to create a record of all actions a user took on the site and what their final order looked like.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC This `clickpaths` table should contain all the fields from your `transactions` table, as well as a count of every `event_name` in its own column. Each user that completed a purchase should have a single row in the final table.

-- COMMAND ----------

CREATE OR REPLACE TEMP VIEW clickpaths AS
  WITH user_event_counts AS (
  SELECT * FROM (
    SELECT user_id user, event_name 
    FROM events_clean
  ) PIVOT ( count(*) FOR event_name IN (
      "cart", "pillows", "login", "main", "careers", "guest", "faq", "down", "warranty", "finalize", 
      "register", "shipping_info", "checkout", "mattresses", "add_item", "press", "email_coupon", 
      "cc_info", "foam", "reviews", "original", "delivery", "premium" )))
SELECT * 
FROM user_event_counts a
JOIN transactions b 
  ON a.user = b.user_id;

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC We can see that our view is simply storing the Spark plan for our query.

-- COMMAND ----------

EXPLAIN FORMATTED SELECT * FROM clickpaths

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC When we execute a query against this view, we will process the plan to generate the logically correct result.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Note that while the data may end up in the Delta Cache, this result is not guaranteed to be persisted, and is only cached for the currently active cluster.

-- COMMAND ----------

SELECT * FROM clickpaths WHERE login = True

-- COMMAND ----------

SELECT *
FROM clickpaths
WHERE user_id = "UA000000102360871"

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC ### An Aside on ACLs
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC While Databricks has extensive support for ACLs, by default these are not enforced for standard data engineering clusters. As such, the default permissions for this view are set to all users, and no owner has been declared.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %python
-- MAGIC import py4j
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC try:
-- MAGIC   spark.sql("SHOW GRANT ON VIEW clickpaths")
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC except py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError as e:
-- MAGIC   print("Error: " + e.java_exception.getMessage())
-- MAGIC   print("Solution: Consider enabling Table Access Control to demonstrate this feature.")

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC While the privileges for this view may not be especially sensitive, we can see that our bronze table (which contains ALL our raw data) is also currently stored in this fashion.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Again, ACLs are primarily intended for managing data access within the Databricks workspace for BI and data science use cases. For sensitive data engineering data, you will want to make sure that you limit access to the storage containers using your cloud identity management.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %python
-- MAGIC try:
-- MAGIC   spark.sql("SHOW GRANT ON TABLE events_raw")
-- MAGIC   
-- MAGIC except py4j.protocol.Py4JJavaError as e:
-- MAGIC   print("Error: " + e.java_exception.getMessage())
-- MAGIC   print("Solution: Consider enabling Table Access Control to demonstrate this feature.")

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md ## Dynamic Views
-- MAGIC Databricks <a href="https://docs.databricks.com/security/access-control/table-acls/object-privileges.html#dynamic-view-functions" target="_blank">dynamic views</a> allow user or group identity ACLs to be applied to data at the column (or row) level.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC Database administrators can configure data access privileges to disallow access to a source table and only allow users to query a redacted view. Users with sufficient privileges will be able to see all fields, while restricted users will be shown arbitrary results, as defined at view creation.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC Consider our `sales` table with the following columns.

-- COMMAND ----------

DESCRIBE sales

-- COMMAND ----------

CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW sales_view AS
SELECT
  order_id,
  transaction_timestamp,
  CASE 
    WHEN is_member('ade_demo') THEN email
    ELSE 'REDACTED'
  END AS email,
  CASE 
    WHEN is_member('ade_demo') THEN purchase_revenue_in_usd
    ELSE 'REDACTED'
  END AS purchase_revenue_in_usd
FROM sales

-- COMMAND ----------

SELECT * FROM sales_view

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC %md
-- MAGIC Now when we query from `sales_view`, only members of the group `ade_demo` will be able to see results in plain text.
-- MAGIC 
-- MAGIC **NOTE:** You may not have privileges to create groups or assign membership. Your instructor should be able to demonstrate how group membership will change query results.
